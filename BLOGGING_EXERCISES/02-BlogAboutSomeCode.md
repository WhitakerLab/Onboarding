# Blog about some code

* **Goal**: Understand a piece of code used by the Whitaker lab well enough to explain it to others
* **Timeline**: Within the first three weeks of you joining the lab
* **Length**: Approximately 500 words, but possibly accompanied by a jupyter notebook

The goal of this blogging exercise is to ensure that you have confidence in running a piece of code that is used (or will be used) in your work at the Whitaker lab.

The brief is very broad: **get a piece of code running and write about 500 words explaining how to use it**.

Your target audience is *you*.

The reason this blog is so close to the beginning of your time in the Whitaker lab is that it becomes much harder to write blogs about getting started once you're a bit more expert.
I'd recommend making notes about what the blog post is going to contain from the very first time that you try to use the code!
Think about trying to make the next person's life easier :raised_hands:

Try to make sure your blog covers these points:

* Why would you want to run this piece of code?
* What did you need to know to get the code running?
* What does the code do to your data?

You might find that creating a jupyter notebook to go along with the blog is useful, along with sharing some screenshots of the different steps.

To upload your blog post, follow the instructions in the [`_posts/blog/template.md`](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/blob/master/_posts/blog/template.md) in the [whitakerlab.github.io website repo](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io).

The blog should be submitted as file in the [`_posts/blog`](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/tree/master/_posts/blog) directory via a pull request.
